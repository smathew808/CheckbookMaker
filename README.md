# CheckbookMaker
This project is a GUI that takes input for Name, Dollar Amount, and Memo. It outputs a check with the ability to create more in the same check GUI

I specifically worked on the Processor class. It handled the dollar amount as a double and outputed the english version of the inputs dollar amount.
